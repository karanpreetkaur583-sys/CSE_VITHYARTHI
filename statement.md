 Problem Statement  
Many people keep track of books using paper or memory.  
They often forget which books are available and which are borrowed.  
Searching for a book takes time, and adding new books is messy.  
We need a simple computer program to solve this.

Scope of the Project  
This is a small Python program that runs in the command window.  
It lets you add, view, borrow, return, and search books.  
All data is saved in a file called books.txt so nothing is lost when you close the program.

Target Users  
- Students doing Python projects  
- Small school libraries  
- Teachers  
- Anyone with a personal book collection  

 High-Level Features  
1. Add new book (title + author)  
2. View all books with status  
3. Borrow a book  
4. Return a book  
5. Search book by name  
6. Saves everything automatically
